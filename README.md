# Monte-Carlo-Based-Particle-Classification-and-Feature-Selection-Using-PCA

PCA Project
In this project, you will classify particles into gamma(signal) or hadrons(background). Given that the features are correlated, you will perform PCA to get a new set of features, and select the features that contain the most information. The data set was generated by a Monte Carlo program, Corsika, described in D. Heck et al., CORSIKA, A Monte Carlo code to simulate extensive air showers, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe FZKA 6019 (1998).

The first part of the project ‘Observing the Dataset’ is in script_1.py. The second part of the project ‘Performing PCA’ is in script_2.py. It is highly recommend that you complete the project on your own without checking the solutions, but feel free to take a look if you get stuck or want to check your answers when you’re done!
